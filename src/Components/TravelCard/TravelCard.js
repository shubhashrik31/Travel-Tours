                    Here we are....fresh into a brand new year. We wish you all
                    a healthy and happy year....and one with many good stories
                    to tell. We stayed pretty busy between Christmas and New
                    Year’s. The park had a Christmas Eve golf cart parade. Many
                    of us decorated our golf carts and drove together througho
                    ut the park.The person leading our parade must have thought
                    we were at the Daytona Speedway. We tried keeping up but we
                    were bouncing around and doing our best just to hold on. We
                    sped past some of the areas as a blur at 100 mph I’m
                    positive.
